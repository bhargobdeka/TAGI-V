# TAGI-V
This repository presents the MATLAB package for TAGI-V for handling heteroscedastic aleatory uncertainty for regression tasks. The package is built on top of the original package for TAGI which can be found here [https://github.com/CivML-PolyMtl/TAGI].  
The package contains the UCI regression datasets such as BostonHousing, Concrete, Elevator etc. in the regression folder as well as the toy problem in the Toy Problems folder inside the regression folder. The codes for running TAGI-V for each dataset can be found inside the folder corresponding to that dataset.
